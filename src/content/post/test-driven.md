## Overview

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where tests are
implemented before the actual code. Implementation progress is then informed by
the test status. 

### Practices

- Cleanup aggressively, avoid duplication
- Auto rerun
- Disabled test cases serve as TODOs

## Partner API Endpoint

## Node.Js Inspector Server

## Unsuccessful: UI Development

## Conclusion

Improves code design, easier to refactor, better test coverage.
